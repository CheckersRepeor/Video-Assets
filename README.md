# README

Welcome to **RoXplode**’s UI assets repo.

This is where I upload UI-related downloads for my YouTube channel — mostly PNGs (icons, UI elements, overlays, thumbnails, etc.), and sometimes other UI-based files too.

## Latest Assets
Click any file name below to open it:

- [Studs.png](./textures/Studs.png)


### Download a single item (recommended)
1. Click any asset file in **Latest Assets** above (it will open the file page).
2. Click the **three dots (⋯)** on the top-right.
3. Click **Download**.
4. The file will save to your computer (usually in your **Downloads** folder).

### Optional: Download everything (ZIP)
If you want all assets in one download:
1. Click the green **Code** button.
2. Click **Download ZIP**.
3. Unzip/extract it, then open the folder to find the assets you want.

**Tip:** If you don’t see **Download**, make sure you’re on the asset’s file page (not the README).
